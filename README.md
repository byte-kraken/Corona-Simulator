# Corona-Simulator
The "Corona Simulator" project is concerned with illustrating the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in a playful way. 
The player slips into the role of the virus and tries to infect as many entities as possible. Calibrating factors such as social distancing and hygiene and the potential to play on different, self-generated playing fields not only allows for a fun escape in a time of crisis, but may also help to better understand the situation we are facing and act appropriately.

## Concept and features
To achieve this goal, we have designed various features. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, not all of them have been fully realised yet - be sure to check in on any updates coming in the future!

The game takes place entirely on a 2D level and was written in JavaFX using the _Model-View-Controller_ pattern. The game consists of different scenes, which will be explained in detail in the following paragraphs. Each scene has its own _Controller_ that implements the logic, an FXML file (_View_) that defines the design of the objects used, and shares a common data _Model_, which stores, for example, the current game state or the loaded world.
